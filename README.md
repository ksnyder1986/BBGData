# BBGData
Data from BoardGameGeek.com and Python code for retrieval of that data.

This contains code that has been modified from the repository https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/tree/master/boardgamegeek
The code in that repository no longer works as coded (or at least did not for me)

In this repository there are two primary python programs for retrieving the data from the website.
